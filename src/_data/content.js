    body: "This reflects a dilemma faced by Mercatus more broadly. In recent years, they have put a lot of effort (from which I benefitted) into a “pluralism” agenda, which was supposed to encourage people to find common ground and have productive conversations across the usual partisan divides. It’s not a bad idea, but at a Mercatus pluralism event about this time last year, the looming unreality of it began to sink in. Much of the discussion seemed useful and appropriate—in a world where Donald Trump had no chance of being elected again. And if Kamala Harris were president right now, it would still seem that way. But in a world where the political divide is between democracy and authoritarianism, between freedom and dictatorship, finding “common ground” with authoritarians just becomes a form of surrender.",

    body: "Sotomayor contended that the majority’s decision might sweep more broadly than her colleagues acknowledged. First, she argued that the line that Roberts drew between official and unofficial conduct \“narrows the conduct considered ‘unofficial’ almost to a nullity. It says that whenever the President acts in a way that is not manifestly or palpably beyond his authority, he is taking official action.” And the majority takes an “expansive view” of the core powers of the presidency, she continued, that “will effectively insulate all sorts of noncore conduct from criminal prosecution.” “In every use of official power,\” she concluded, \“the President is now a king above the law.\”",
